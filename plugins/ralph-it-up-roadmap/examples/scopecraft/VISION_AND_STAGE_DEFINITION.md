# Vision and Stage Definition

> Example output from ralph-it-up-roadmap plugin

## Product Vision

**Customer:** Early-stage startup founders and product managers
**Problem:** Scattered PRDs, legacy task lists, and unclear maturity milestones make roadmap planning chaotic
**Value:** Automated synthesis of existing docs into a clear, prioritized roadmap with PMF metrics

## Current Stage

**Stage:** MVP
**Evidence:**
- No monitoring or observability
- Manual installation process
- Limited error handling
- Single plugin in marketplace

## Next Major Stage

**Target:** Beta Release
**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] 3+ plugins in marketplace
- [ ] Automated validation on plugin submission
- [ ] Usage analytics instrumented
- [ ] Documentation site live
- [ ] 10+ external users

## Assumptions

- Users have existing PRDs or docs to scan
- Claude Code plugin system remains stable
- Markdown-based output is preferred format

## Constraints

- Must work offline (no external API calls)
- Output must be human-readable without tooling
- Plugin size must remain small for fast installation
